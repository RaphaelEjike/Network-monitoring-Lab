# Network-monitoring-Lab

## Objective

The Network monitoring Lab is aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting network ativities. The primary focus was generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

## Tools Used

<ul>
  <li>Network analysis tools (Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic</li>
  <li>Telemetry generation tools (Zenmap - Nping) to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios</li>
</ul>

## Workflow

#### Install and Use Network Analysis Tools:
<ul>
<li>Install Wireshark, capture and analyze network traffic.</li>
</ul>

#### Generate Telemetry:

<ul>
<li>Install Zenmap and Nping, perform scans, simulate attacks, and analyze results.</li>
</ul>

#### Correlate and Document:

<ul>
<li>Document findings, create reports.</li>
</ul>


## Steps for Setting Up the Network monitoring Lab

### Capturing and Examining Network Traffic:

### Objective:
<ul> 
<li> To monitor, capture, and analyse network traffic to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential signs of cyber attacks. </li>
</ul>

### Actions:
### Install Wireshark:
<ul> 
<li> Installed Wireshark on one of the VMs or a dedicated analysis machine to serve as the primary tool for network traffic analysis.</li>
<li> Ensured that the necessary permissions were obtained to allow Wireshark to capture and analyse network traffic without restrictions.</li>
</ul> 

### Configure Network Interfaces:
<ul> 
<li> Identified and selected the appropriate network interface(s) on the VM or analysis machine to monitor the desired network segments.</li>
<li> Configured filters within Wireshark to focus on capturing specific types of traffic, such as HTTP, DNS, or TCP, which are critical for the analysis of normal operations and attack scenarios.</li>
</ul> 

### Capture Traffic:
<ul> 
<li> Initiated packet capture during periods of normal network operation as well as during simulated cyber attacks to gather a broad range of traffic data.</li>
<li> Saved captured packets to files for detailed, post-capture analysis, ensuring that all relevant data was preserved for future reference.</li>
</ul> 


### Analyse Traffic:
<ul> 
<li> Utilised Wireshark's advanced filtering and analysis tools to thoroughly inspect the captured traffic.</li>
<li> Identified patterns, anomalies, or potential signs of cyber attacks, such as unusual port scanning activity or suspicious DNS queries, to assess the security posture of the network.</li>
</ul> 

## Skills Learned Recap
<ul>
  <li> Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs</li>
  <li> Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns</li>
  <li> Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilitie</li>
  <li> Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity</li>
</ul>
