# Network-monitoring-Lab

## Objective

The Network monitoring Lab is aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting network ativities. The primary focus was generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

## Tools Used

<ul>
  <li>Network analysis tools (Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic</li>
  <li>Telemetry generation tools (Zenmap - Nping) to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios</li>
</ul>

## Workflow

#### Install and Use Network Analysis Tools:
<ul>
<li>Install Wireshark, capture and analyze network traffic.</li>
</ul>

#### Generate Telemetry:

<ul>
<li>Install Zenmap and Nping, perform scans, simulate attacks, and analyze results.</li>
</ul>

#### Correlate and Document:

<ul>
<li>Document findings, create reports.</li>
</ul>
